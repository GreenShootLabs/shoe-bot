# Shoe Bot - 0.0.1
This is a sample application that pulls in the [Open Dialog core](https://github.com/opendialogai/core) and [Open Dialog Webchat](https://github.com/opendialogai/webchat/) packages and provides a demonstration of the OpenDialog platform with webchat. 


# Set Up Instructions

## Quickstart
This will get you up and running with minimal manual configuration.

* [Install](https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/system-requirements.html) [lando](https://github.com/lando/lando)
 -- Lando is a wrapper around Docker services and it brings together everything that is required for OpenDialog.
 
* Run the setup script: `bash ./scripts/set_up_od.sh {appname}` where {appname} is the name of the app
* Now you can go to: https://opendialog.lndo.site/demo
* You should see the no-match message 
* The DGraph browser will be available here: http://dgraph-ratel.lndo.site/?latest
  * DGraph Alpha should be available at locahost:8081

## Manual Configuration

### Front end set up

After running `composer install` or `composer update`, an update script file should be moved to the root of your project
directory. Run this script to set up the OpenDialogAI-Webchat and OpenDialogAI-Core packages with

```bash update-web-chat.sh -i```

#### Options

The following options are available on the script:

+ `-h` Get help
+ `-p` Set if this is to be run in the production environment
+ `-l` Set if you are using Lando for local development. Will run the commands from within Lando
+ `-i` Set if you need to install the node dependencies. This defaults to false, so you should always set this for the fist run
+ `-f` Whether to force updating by deleting local dependencies. If set, will remove the vue-beautiful-chat node module before reinstalling 

Run this script every time an underlying package is updated.

#### Webchat Configuration 

The webchat configuration can be found in the `webchat_settings` table. The config table should be seeded by running:

```php artisan webchat:setup```

This will set up the `webchat_settings` table with all the requried values.
For this to work successfully, the `APP_URL` environment variable need to be set

### DGraph configuration

#### Running DGraph

If you don't have a `dgraph` directory in the root of your project, run

```php artisan vendor:publish --tag=dgraph```

to copy it over from the OpenDialogAi-Core package.

Now follow the instructions found in `dgraph-setup.md`

#### Config

Publish the opendialog config by running:

```php artisan vendor:publish --tag=opendialog-config```

This will copy over all required config files to `config/opendialog` for you to add you own values

Add (and edit as necessary) the following lines to your .env file to let OD know where to find your DGraph installation:
```
DGRAPH_URL=http://10.0.2.2
DGRAPH_PORT=8080
```

These settings should work out of the box if you are using Laravel Homestead. More info in `draph/dgraph-setup.md`

## Conversations

Conversations in OpenDialog are managed in the mysql database, and published to DGraph when they are ready to be used.

There are 2 scripts included with this application that allow you to import and export conversations that can be checked into 
the repo and shared

### Configuration

There is a config file `opendialog/active_conversations.php` in the config directory. This contains a list of all conversation
names that should be exported / imported. This list is used by both scripts and should be kept up to date with your local conversations.
Just the conversation name is needed.

### Import Conversations

To import all conversations, run

```php artisan conversations:setup```

This will import all conversations that are listed in `opendialog/active_conversations.php` and exist in `resources/conversartions`

#### Example Conversations

By default, the welcome and no match conversations are included with OpenDialog. Running the script will create a no match
and a welcome conversation (but without the required messages)

### Exporting Conversations

Run:

```php artisan conversations:export```

To export all conversations in the `opendialog/active_conversations.php` config file. This will dump the current conversation
YAML and all related outgoing intents and message templates

## Local dev

A `composer-dev.json` file has been created to help with local development. It makes the assumption that you have the 
Open Dialog and Open Dialog Webchat packages checked out locally to `../OpenDialog` and `../OpenDialog-Webchat`
respectively.

To install dependencies using it, you can run `./composer-dev install` or `./composer-dev update`

After doing so, you may need to run `php artisan package:discover` to pick up any new modules.

Note:

+ Any changes made in `composer-dev.json` must be reflected in `composer.json` and vice versa
+ Before a final commit for a feature / fix, please be sure to run `composer update` to update the `composer-lock.json`
file so that it can be tested and deployed with all composer changes in place

## Running Code Sniffer
To run code sniffer, run the following command
```./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=psr12 app/ -n```

## Git Hooks

To set up the included git pre-commit hook, first make sure the pre-commit script is executable by running

```chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit```

Then configure your local git to use this directory for git hooks by running:

```git config core.hooksPath .githooks/```

Now every commit you make will trigger php codesniffer to run. If there is a problem with the formatting
of the code, the script will echo the output of php codesniffer. If there are no issues, the commit will
go into git.
