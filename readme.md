# Shoe Bot 1.1.0
This is a sample application that pulls in the [Open Dialog core](https://github.com/opendialogai/core) and [Open Dialog Webchat](https://github.com/opendialogai/webchat/) packages and provides a demonstration of the OpenDialog platform with webchat. 

OpenDialog enables you to quickly design, develop and deploy conversational applications. 

You write conversational applications using OpenDialog's flexible conversational language, and define the messages that your bot will send the user through OpenDialog's message markup language. 

The OpenDialog webchat widget allows you to interact with the application - it supports both an in-page popup experience as well as a full-page experience and mobile.
